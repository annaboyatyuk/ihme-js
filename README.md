Your goal is to:

Create a data visualization that helps the user answer the following question – “What population is most affected by opioid use disorders?”
Provide a method of interactivity (e.g. toggle, dropdown, etc.) to dynamically update the visualization
Note: The type of chart to use is up to you. Select the type that you think would best answer the question above given the available data.

What we are looking for (in order of importance):

Understanding of code/usage of best practices. Does the code adhere to best practices? How is it structured? Is the code your own or collected bits from bl.ocks and Stack Overflow? This is your opportunity to display your understanding and skill with the JavaScript language.
Visual understanding. Is the data being presented in a way that is visually meaningful?
Visual appeal. Do the visual elements add to the story or detract from it?
